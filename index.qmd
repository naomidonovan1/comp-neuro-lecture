### What is computational neuroscience? 
![adapted from: https://compneuro.neuromatch.io/tutorials/intro.html](./images/ConceptMap.png)

## 
| generally, the goal of neuroscience is to understand the nervous system...
|       --> how it develops
|       --> what its components are 
|       --> how all of those components work together
|       --> how it produces behavior 
|       etc.

| 
| we think of some hypothesis, perform some experiments, collect some data... 
| 
| and then build or use a model to understand how that data supports (or disproves) our hypothesis

##
### essentially, once we have some data... 
###     what do we do with it?

## 
#### today, our goal is to help answer that question

##
### Agenda
- ~~what is computational neuroscience?~~
- some coding basics
- demo: time-series data (systems-focus)
- demo: single-cell genomics data (molecular-focus)
- some extra topics we think are fun
