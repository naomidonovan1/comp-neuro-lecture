## 
| generally, the goal of neuroscience is to understand the nervous system...
::: {.incremental}
- how it develops
- what its components are 
- how all of those components work together
- how it produces behavior 
- etc.

## 
#### we hope by the end of this lesson, you should all feel comfortable
::: {.incremental}
- visualizing data
- analyzing data
- and modeling data

### Agenda 
::: {.incremental}
- ~~what is computational neuroscience?~~
- some coding basics
- demo: time-series data (systems-focus)
- demo: single-cell genomics data (molecular-focus)
- some extra topics we think are fun
